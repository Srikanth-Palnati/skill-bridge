3. Set Up Environment
Create a .env file and update with the following values:

This will also seed a default admin user.

Admin is created automatically when migrations are run.

Student Features
Students can register themselves from the registration page.

After registering, they can log in and access student-specific functionality.

Additional Notes
To test email functionality, ensure "Allow less secure apps" is enabled in the Gmail settings (if using a real Gmail account).

Make sure QUEUE_CONNECTION=database is set, and run:

php artisan queue:work
